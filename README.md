# Account Management System

## Description

- **Withdraw Funds**: Withdraw money from an account, ensuring sufficient balance.
- **Delete Account**: Permanently delete an account from the system.
- **Search Accounts**: Search for accounts by the account holder's name.
- **Data Storage**: Uses a `HashMap` as the data source for storing accounts, allowing for efficient retrieval and manipulation.
